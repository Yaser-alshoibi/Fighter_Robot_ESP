# Fighter Robot ESP


In this project, I will show my complete front end and back end and ESP programming codes for the Fighter robot منافِس

All project files and database are attached. I also uploaded to ESP codes one for ESP8266 and the other for ESP32.

# AP Mode Login

First, the ESP will work in Access Point mode and the user will open the login page and enter network SSID and Password.

# Working in STA mode

After connecting to the router, the user will be able to use the robot movement interface to control the robot.
**Note: I merged both motors control interface and base motors interface so it will be easier to use the robot than splitting them into two pages.**

Here I showed both working modes for ESP and data received by ESP.

**Note: Unmute the video to hear my explanation.**
